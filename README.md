At other times, the wooden board will be much larger and there will be more Cropses to match, such as this: due to the different shapes and layouts of the wooden board, it is worth observing its appearance and content. A smaller chessboard will limit your chances of matching, while having more Cropses on a larger chessboard may lead to more consecutive matches and combinations, resulting in bonuses (more on this later).
